## Abstract

Detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) is crucial, and one effective method is using an intrusion detection system (IDS) integrated with supervised machine learning algorithms. These algorithms require a balanced dataset with ample attack samples to learn and recognize attack patterns effectively. However, widely used APT datasets, such as **DAPT2020** and **SCVIC-APT-2021**, suffer from imbalance issues, which limit the performance of machine learning-based IDS.

To address this, we introduce **DSRL-APT-2023**, a new balanced synthetic APT dataset generated with **CTGAN**. We trained the CTGAN model on the DAPT2020 dataset to create this balanced dataset.

## Evaluation and Comparison

We evaluate and compare the performance of six common supervised machine learning algorithms:

- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Multi-Layer Perceptron

Alongside these, we also assess an **Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** based on tree-structured machine learning models. Our evaluation focuses on detecting attacks in DSRL-APT-2023 and compares it to **DAPT2020** and **SCVIC-APT-2021**.

## Synthetic Dataset Generation Quality

Additionally, we compare the data quality of synthetic datasets generated by two prominent GANs, **CopulaGAN** and **CTGAN**, with **CTGAN** demonstrating slightly superior performance in generating high-quality tabular data.

## Results

Our results show that both the machine learning algorithms and the intelligent IDS can accurately detect attacks in the synthetic dataset, as indicated by the **F1-Score** metrics.
